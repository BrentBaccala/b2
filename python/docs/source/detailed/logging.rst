Notes
--------

Logging is enabled for PyBertini through Bertini2's core logging facilities, in turn powered by Boost.Log.  

They currently aren't fancy, but you have a few things you can do.

#. Adjust the level.  See :class:`~pybertini.logging.severity_level` and :function:`~pybertini.logging.set_level`
