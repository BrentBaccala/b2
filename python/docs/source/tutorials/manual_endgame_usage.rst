ðŸŽ® Using an endgame to compute singular endpoints 
*********************************************************



Background
==============

Polynomial systems often have singular solutions.  In numerical algebraic geometry, we want to compute all solutions, even the challenging singular ones.  The normal method of homotopy continuation with straight-line tracking fails to compute such roots, because tracking to a place where the Jacobian is non-invertible using methods that require inverting the Jacobian is doomed to fail [#]_.  

So, if we can't track to a singular solution, but we still want to track to compute them, what are we to do?  We track around them, or near them, but not actually to them.  These methods are collectively called *endgames*, a term coined to evoke a sense of chess :cite:`morgan1990computing` :cite:`morgan1992computing` :cite:`morgan1992power`.  Thanks, Andrew Sommese, Charles Wampler, and Alexander Morgan, for everything you have given our community.

Endgames represent a way to finish a tracking of a path, when the endpoint is possibly singular.  Rather than track all the way to the endtime, you instead run an endgame that uses mathematical theory to compute the root.

Endgames in PyBertini
==========================

An endgame is a computational tool that one does in the final stage of a path track to a possibly singular root.  There are two implemented endgames in Bertini:

#. Power series (PSEG) -- uses `Hermite interpolation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_interpolation>`_ across a sequence of geometrically-spaced points (in time) to extrapolate to a target time :cite:`morgan1992power`. 
#. Cauchy (CauchyEG)-- uses `Cauchy's integral formula <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy's_integral_formula>`_ in a sequence of circles about the root you are computing.  

Both try to compute the cycle number :math:`c` for the root.  In PSEG, :math:`c` is used as the degree of a Hermite interpolant used to extrapolate to 0.  In CauchyEG,  it is used for the number of cycles to walk before doing a trapezoid-rule integral.

Each is provided in the three precision modes, double, fixed multiple, and adaptive.  Since we are using the :class:`~pybertini.tracking.AMPTracker` in this tutorial, we will of course use the adaptive endgame.  I really like the Cauchy endgame, so we're in the land of the :class:`~pybertini.endgame.AMPCauchyEG`.


Example
----------

Form a system
------------------






Track to the endgame boundary
----------------------------------





Use the endgame
----------------------------------------


To make an endgame, we need to feed it the tracker that is used to run.  There are also config structs to play with, that control the way things are computed.

::

	eg = pybertini.endgame.AMPCauchyEG(tr)

Since the endgame hasn't been run yet things are empty and default::

	assert(eg.cycle_number()==0)
	assert(eg.final_approximation()==pybertini.VectorXmp())

The endgames are used by invoking ``run``, feeding it the point we are tracking on, the time we are at, and the time we want to track to.
