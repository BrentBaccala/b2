Welcome to PyBertini
====================================

We're glad you are here with us.  Bertini is software for numerically solving systems of polynomials.  PyBertini is the Python provided for running Bertini interactively.

The main algorithm in Bertini is homotopy continuation.  A homotopy is formed, and the solutions to the start system are continued into the solutions for the target system.
